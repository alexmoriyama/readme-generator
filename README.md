# Readme Generator

## Task Description
For this task I was asked to create a readme generator containing different sections populated via Javascript Node. For the project I was asked to make sure the readme generator had Description, table of contents, installation, usage, contributing, tests, and question sections. Within these sections I would add text via the nodejs inquirer installation. From here we made sure to have a link to our Github as well as adding an avenue for further questions so I linked my email.

## Preview
For my preview I have a screen recording that displays the features of the app.

## Contributions
Thank you to my TA's and my fellow classmates for helping me construct this generator.
